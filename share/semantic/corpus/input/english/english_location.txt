My chair is behind me
My chair is behind the chair
My chair is behind me and you
My chair is behind the chair and the table
My chair is behind me and behind the chair
I am behind you and me

I am in front of you
I am in front of me and you
I am in front of you and me


This car is next to my house
Your pen is under my desk
Your pen is on my desk
My house is far away from your school
My house is far from your school
This city is close to Paris

I go to Germany
I eat in the kitchen

My chair is behind me and the chair

The answer is in \any_url=https://diocese92.fr/\
I see a moving object next to me.
