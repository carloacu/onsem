I like anyone
I am fond of banana
he is like you
he likes you

he tenses
the tense is like this

cool
It's cool
It's not cool
i am never happy


This movie doesn't care about cleverness, wit or any other kind of intelligent humor.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.
There are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting.

Seeing your face makes me reconsider living on this planet.


I am a little bit sad, actually
